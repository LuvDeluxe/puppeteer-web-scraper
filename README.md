# puppeteer-web-scraper
A web scraper built with Puppeteer to extract job data from Dev.BG, a website posting numerous job ads. The scraper fetches relevant job information, such as job titles, company names, locations, and more, and displays the data in the console.

If you want to run the script, download, unzip and in the root directory run: NPM start. In index.js you can change how many types of jobs you want to scrape by setting the variable: let jobsToScrape = 5
